            Contacts who block a chatbot number leads to the reduction in quality rating of the chatbot by Meta. This
            can reduce the limit of business initiated conversations.
          </li>
          <li>
            Kindly plan to message large number of new contacts in batches to avoid having quality reduced or having
            your chatbot blocked by Meta.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </div>
